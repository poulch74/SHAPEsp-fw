how i can effectively block "publish" from sending messages or check state of
connection in more speed manner?
The problem is - low heap. For example after onConnect I start publish messages each 1 sec to
remoute mqtt server. All ok until WAN interface of my router goes down. if keepAlive
is about 15 then "publish" eat all heap but I not receive any onError or onDisconnect
and MCU fail and reboot. I can limit keepAlive to 3, so until heap goes low 
onDisconnect fired and i can recovery. but I think it not right way... (keepAlive can be under user control)
I can check heap and block "publish"... but... so which right way?
